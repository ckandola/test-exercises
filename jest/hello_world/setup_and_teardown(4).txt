beforeEach
afterEach

both can handle asynchronous code in the same way 
that tests can. 

beforeAll,
afterAll

Group tests together in a describe block. When inside
a describe block, the `before` and `after` blocks 
only apply to tests within that block.

All describe handlers are executed before the actual
tests, so it may make sense to do setup and teardown
inside `before` and `after` handlers rather than in
the describe blocks.

Once describe blocks are complete, Jest runs all the
tests serially in the order they were encountered in
the collection phase.

When a test is failing, check if it still fails when
it runs alone with `test.only()`. If not, then some
shared state should be cleared with `beforeEach`.
